# Create My React App

Barebone React app with only minimal elements:
  - Webpack
  - Babel
  - React

Files inside src/ folder are basic test files.

## Instalation

### Git Clone
- `git clone https://github.com/JAS0NHUANG/create-my-react-app.git`
- `yarn install` (install yarn with `sudo npm install -g yarn`)
- `npm run start`
- Check out the page @ localhost:8080

### create-my-react-app script

Since cloning the whole repository will also include git files and you have to change the project name manually. Just use this simple shell script to create a basic React project automatically.
